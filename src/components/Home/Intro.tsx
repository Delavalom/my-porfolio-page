          I worked in a 1500-employee health company in the Dominican Republic,
          helping to migrate a sizable system for their life insurance
          operations. It was an exciting challenge, and I learned a lot about
          software development and system integration. The project was a
          success, and I was proud to contribute to the company&apos;s success.
