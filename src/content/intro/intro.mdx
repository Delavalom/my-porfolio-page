<p>I'm a full-stack developer with over three years of experience in building high-performance web applications. I'm an active open-source contributor and a member of the tRPC and T3 stack communities. I'm passionate about frontend development, and also I teach developers at [codedamn.com](https://codedamn.com) how to create fast and type-safe full-stack applications.

My journey began as a junior developer for a major health insurance company, where I played a pivotal role in migrating their legacy desktop software to a web application. During the next two years, I evolved automation and workflow applications that helped improve response time to the customer at the international product team. Also, I made valuable contributions by implementing a new data management web app for the life insurance team. 

After I quit my previous work, I got into web3 where I developed for a web3 trust funds company. There I worked on UI and smart contract development.</p>
